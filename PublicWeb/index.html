            <h2>What is C&C Rules Editor?</h2>
            <p>
                The C&C Rules Editor is a comprehensive Windows desktop application designed for modding and editing Command & Conquer games. 
                This editor is made to edit ini files and maps for Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2 and all mods related to these editions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new must-have tool for any modders and map editors - modding and map editing was never so easy! 
                Also a good tool for regular gamers - make your own modified game in minutes just by clicky-clicky, no programming skills needed!
            </p>
            <p>
                Just save the modified rules in your game folder and the game will use them - you have now modified your game! It's that easy. 
                To play modified games on multiplayer, share the 'rules.ini' file to all the players in the lobby; 
                every player in a multiplayer session must have the same 'rules.ini' in the game folder.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        I'm checking out your tool otherdeniz, really amazing!<br>
                        So far everything seems very user-friendly, I loaded my mod with ease, LOVE how easy it is to clone units, 
                        and all the possible rules to each technotype are available, included vinifera features which is super nice 
                        and makes modding soo much nicer.<br>
                        The shp preview on top is sweet!<br>
                        The balancing tool is straightforward, immensely handy, can make quick balancing edits with ease, wow!<br>
                        Visibly seeing all projectiles and explosion is a game changer<br>
                        Yeey it's got a dark theme!<br>
                        OMG the mix content browser!! wow!! finally!! Can easily find a file through all mix files<br>
                        Inserting snippet and able to export changes to snippet (ini file) is brilliant, will come in handy for 
                        the uploaded mods that are on cncnet for all mappers<br>
                        Great work on the filter!!! But I didn't notice it until very late, maybe it should also include the word 
                        'Filter' in the button. (I had no idea what that icon was lol)<br>
                        Favoriting units/buildings is also very handy.<br>
                        So is 'Take values from', very nice.<br>
                        AI editing is much easier now as well
                    </p>

            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>
                Once the user defines a game path of an integrated game or adds a custom mod, the cameos get loaded from the MIX files 
                of the game directory. After the editor knows the path to a game, many features are unlocked:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insert new buildings/units</li>
                <li>Play sounds</li>
                <li>Play animations</li>
                <li>Browse MIX file contents</li>
                <li>Preview cameos and graphics</li>
                <li>And much more...</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The editor is fully dynamic - you can edit the JSON files in the "Resources" subfolder to fully customize the integrated games. 
                The integrated games are defined in 'games.json' and all value definitions are defined in 'datastructure.json'.
