This instructs the TeamType to use the TaskForce to move to the waypoint number specified by the parameter. The difference is that the units in the TaskForce will move out of their patrol route to actively go and engage any enemy objects that are within their Sight= as they move to the waypoint. NOTE: this action eats up processor time, because the TaskForce will scan for enemy objects with each movement. If you have a lot of TaskForces (or lots of units in them) engaged in this action, you will experience slowdown in the game - this is one reason why the single player missions are comparatively slow, they use this action a lot. The rate at which the scanning for targets whilst in this mission is controlled by the PatrolScan= statement in the [AI]section of RULES.INI."

It is this action which enables use of the TransportsReturnOnUnload=yes statement in the corresponding TeamType entry. The second purpose is to flag the transport as being 'loaded' with passengers and thus is considered in the AI's targeting logic as a potential threat (see the ContentScan= entry in the RULES.INI).
