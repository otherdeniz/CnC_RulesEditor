PassengerDeletion.Rate=0                        ; integer, game frames, determines the interval in game frames that it takes to erase a single passenger.
PassengerDeletion.Rate.SizeMultiply=true        ; If set to true, this time interval is multiplied by the passenger’s Size.
PassengerDeletion.UseCostAsRate=false           ; if set to true, changes the time interval for erasing a passenger to be based on the passenger’s Cost. This does not factor in modifiers like FactoryPlant.
PassengerDeletion.CostMultiplier=1.0            ; floating point value, percents or absolute, can be used to modify the cost-based time interval.
PassengerDeletion.CostRateCap=                  ; integer, game frames, can be used to set a cap to the cost-based time interval.
PassengerDeletion.AllowedHouses=all             ; Affected House Enumeration (none|owner/self|allies/ally|team|enemies/enemy|all) determines which houses passengers can belong to be eligible for deletion.
PassengerDeletion.DontScore=false               ; if set to true, makes it so that the deleted passengers are not counted as having been killed by the transport (no experience, not recorded towards owning house’s score etc).
PassengerDeletion.Soylent=false                 ; if set to true, an amount of credits is refunded to the owner of the transport. The exact amount refunded is determined by the passengers Soylent, or if not set, its Cost (this is affected by modifiers such as FactoryPlant).
PassengerDeletion.SoylentMultiplier=1.0         ; float, percents or absolute, is a direct multiplier applied to the refunded amount of credits.
PassengerDeletion.SoylentAllowedHouses=enemies  ; Affected House Enumeration (none|owner/self|allies/ally|team|enemies/enemy|all) determines which houses passengers can belong to be eligible for refunding.
PassengerDeletion.DisplaySoylent=false          ; can be set to true to display the amount of credits refunded on the transport. 
PassengerDeletion.DisplaySoylentToHouses=All    ; Affected House Enumeration (none|owner/self|allies/ally|team|enemies/enemy|all) determines which houses can see this and PassengerDeletion.DisplaySoylentOffset can be used to adjust the display offset.
PassengerDeletion.DisplaySoylentOffset=0,0      ; X,Y, pixels relative to default
PassengerDeletion.ReportSound=                  ; Sound
