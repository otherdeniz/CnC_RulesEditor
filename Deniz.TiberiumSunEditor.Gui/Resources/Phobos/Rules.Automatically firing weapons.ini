AutoFire=false             ; you can now make TechnoType automatically fire its weapon(s) without having to scan for suitable targets by setting AutoFire, on either its base cell (in which case the weapon that is used for force-firing is used)
AutoFire.TargetSelf=false  ; or itself (in which case normal targeting and weapon selection rules and are respected) depending on if AutoFire.TargetSelf is set or not.
