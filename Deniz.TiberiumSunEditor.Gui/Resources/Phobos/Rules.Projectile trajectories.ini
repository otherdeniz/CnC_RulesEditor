Trajectory.Speed=100.0                         ; Trajectory should not be combined with original game’s projectile trajectory logics (Arcing, ROT, Vertical or Inviso). Attempt to do so will result in the other logics being disabled and a warning being written to log file.
Trajectory=                                    ; Trajectory type (Straight|Bombard)
Trajectory.Straight.DetonationDistance=0.4     ; controls the maximum distance in cells from intended target (checked at start of each game frame, before the projectile moves) at which the projectile will be forced to detonate. Set to 0 to disable forced detonation.
Trajectory.Straight.ApplyRangeModifiers=false  ; boolean
Trajectory.Straight.TargetSnapDistance=0.5     ; controls the maximum distance in cells from intended target the projectile can be at moment of detonation to make the projectile ‘snap’ on the intended target. Set to 0 to disable snapping.
Trajectory.Straight.PassThrough=false          ; enables special case logic where the projectile does not detonate in contact with the target but ínstead travels up to a distance defined by Trajectory.Straight.DetonationDistance.
Trajectory.Bombard.Height=0.0                  ; Similar trajectory to Straight, but targets a coordinate above the intended target (height determined by Trajectory.Bombard.Height)
